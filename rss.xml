&lt;h2&gt;The goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a personal site. A blog, a place to put things I’ve worked on, a place I hope people might find interesting to visit once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had a personal site for probably the better part of a decade now, but it’s almost always been something thrown together quickly from a theme, and left to die as a floating bit of internet with one or two pages of lacklustre content. I’ve always wanted to do something of my own - something that would be my work, rather than something primarily influenced by a random theme or author out there (Not that there’s anything wrong with using one!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of goal is also reflected in my approach to the styling of the page. I’ve gotta admit - I’m not a natural at design. My approach towards design has always been from the develoer’s perspective of &lt;em&gt;just get it done&lt;/em&gt;, and that shows with my heavy use of CSS frameworks, themes, and boilerplates. This page is constructed entirely with hand-written CSS3, using flexbox. (Well, excluding typography, icons, and animations - I lied a bit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like every site should have some sort of monument to the technologies and decisions made in constructing it. Tech as a field, especially, stands on the shoulders of giants in a way that’s visible in every single interaction with it - A million layers of abstraction, and billions of hours of work have gone into this site - and basically all of it wasn’t mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gatsby - Gatsby is really neat. Not only does it let you write static sites using react and javascript, it also supports a huge range of features and a vibrant community. Some some of my favourite are: …&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Github Pages - Free hosting with the same service that I put all my code in? Yes please.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Github Actions - Unfortunately, github pages doesn’t support gatsby out of the box. Github actions auotmatically builds and deploys this site to github pages every time I update it. Meaning I could write a blog post with nothing but a web-browser, and have it deployed basically instantly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Font Awesome - Super duper handy and neat icon library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typography JS - Elegant, beautiful, clean typography, with as much customisation and themeing as you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, not giving credit to the hundreds of javascript packages involved with anything that vaguely touches javascript. This (fairly minimal) project alone has over 30 direct dependencies, and if you ever want a good graph traversal dataset, you can delve into the monstrosity that underlies them. (At time of writing, gatsby alone had a few hundred total dependencies, and had a graph that looked like this:)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello World]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hello World!

&lt;p&gt;One, two! One, two! And through and through&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He left it dead, and with its head&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went galumphing back.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve deicded to leave it here for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always found my relationship with blogging to be an interesting one. I admire, respect, and consume a lot of content from blogs, mostly around technology and business, and it’s something that I’ve wanted to get into for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, writing is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;. I mean this in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing in general, as in putting down your thoughts and articulating them in an expressive, interesting way, takes genuine mental effort — shock horror, I know. Turns out having interesting thoughts, introspections, and ideas is easy, but fleshing them out takes time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing is something that I, and many others with perfectionistic tendencies tend to never finish. Content is always /just/ not good enough, it can always /just/ get a little more editing, and it’s always /just/ not ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing is something that’s easy to assign your self worth to. This is another thing that I think perfectionistic people tend to do a lot. I find that you write your thoughts down and present it to &lt;em&gt;the world&lt;/em&gt; (ha, as if anyone is going to read this), it feels like you’re putting a bit of your intellectual self on a platter. For someone like me, that feels pretty scary and vulnerable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, I think writing and expressing myself in a format like this is useful in a fair few ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing down your thoughts and ideas presents you with a log of the way you think for posterity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing down your thoughts forces you to properly explore and identify the thoughts you’re having, which, not only develops those ideas, also makes it easier to do that in the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these thoughts might genuinely be useful to somebody — be they future me, or even some random on the internet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I’m trying to get more into the mindset of lowering my standards and be a bit more stream of conciousness-y, at least for articles like this. I think it would be cool to write a few deep-dives and more polished articles/stories/posts/whatever you call it on medium — on topics and areas where I feel I have real insight, or something valuable to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhows, this was a quick blog post to try and start me off on hopefully a habit of writing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
